title: "Stalking and dates"

---


<p>I thought for my first post I will start with a new very recent story. I am working in a coffee shop, I love it, but there is covid-19 so we were just chilling at home for the past 5 months. I&#39;m a person who loves working, I can&#39;t really understand people to be honest, that is why I love working that won&#39;t change. Sometimes I try to have friends, but I always end up with awkward situations.</p>

<p>For example, if someone knows you, and you might have depression and just got bad news. You might end up drinking in a bar, just to get over it, didn&#39;t notice the people around you, because your eyes are crap now.</p>

<p>So you have your drinks, and decide to go home, feeling unwell, walking around the area without a destination. Well you have to be careful with that because you might get just labelled as a stalker for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is I love working, but our shop is located in another shop, so we can&#39;t open yet, but someone from our company found a video, where a man was making latte art by pouring the milk out of a bottle.</p>

<p>We got the challange to do the same, I am at home so I don&#39;t have any special equipment, and I made a deal: if I can make it, I can have a pop up coffee stand.</p>

Great, but I need video evidence of it. Absolutely no problem. I just got a new hobby in the past 5 months which is video editing. My recording skills are not good, but I am working on it.

So I made a nice broll of the processs making coffee at home, but the hard part when I have to record myself making latte art. There is nobody to hold the camera, so I taped an action camera to my head.

Well it didn&#39;t work out, so I asked my friend to help me record the video.

His answer was: -&quot;We gonna find a date for you.&quot;

I was just standing thinking, that could be an interesting date filming me making coffee. I might just make and advert for it:

<p style="text-align: center">
&quot; <b>!Looking for a date!</b><br>

preferably women, age between 18 –99 (<i>even lego didn&#39;t recommended over 99</i>)<br>

Camera skills are not mandatory, but massive extra points if you have it.<br>

Please send an e-mail with your CV to the link.&quot;
</p >

Thankfully it is looks like we will reopen soon, so I no longer need the video, but I am not sure if should I inform my frined or not, he is so excited to find me a date...

… I am a bit worried, I might have to make a movie, that is gonna be the new star wars. I am not saving on effects, I am saving on camera crew.
